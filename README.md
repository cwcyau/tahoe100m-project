## Background
 
The Tahoe-100M data set is the largest single-cell perturbation data set in the world. The data contains 100 million single-cell gene expression profiles from 47 cancer lines, derived from 13 different organs, which have been subject to perturbation by 379 drugs targeting 325 genes. This dataset captures 17,813 unique cell line-drug conditions. 

## Problem

Let $$X_i^{(p)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ and $Z_i \in \\{1, \dots, P \\}$ denote
